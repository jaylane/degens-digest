# Cline Rules for Degen's Digest Project

This file captures project-specific patterns, preferences, and intelligence learned during development and usage.

## Initial Thoughts (To be updated)
-   Parsing Reddit comments will likely require flexible regex. Document successful patterns here.
-   Need to identify reliable CSS selectors or HTML structures for finding the POTD thread and comments.
-   Track any specific user formatting conventions observed in comments that help with parsing.
-   Note any issues encountered with Playwright interaction or Reddit blocking.
