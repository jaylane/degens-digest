hshueuejtifkcnx,32-14,"Arsenal vs Fulham - BTTS",+135,N/A,Soccer,Premier League,N/A,"I get some complaints from time to time that a lot of my picks are in the -140 and up range, and people want more juice. Well, here’s some juice for y’all. I think the bookmakers have this one wrong, this should be around -130 in my opinion. I don’t think anyone doubts Arsenal’s ability to score at home so I won’t spend too much time yapping about it. Arsenal has scored in 22 of their last 25 home games. In the last 2 games that they were held scoreless, they were without Saka, who is the oil for the Arsenal machine. He is back and expected to play tomorrow. In the third scoreless home match for Arsenal, they had 13 shots with 5 on target. They should have scored. This was an anomaly and we won’t delve into it. Fulham is where I think the bookmakers have it wrong. They themselves are at +110 to score. This Fulham team is great on the road and love to find the back of the net. They have scored in their last 17 away games, and 19 of their last 20 away games. They just find a way over and over again. Fulham also has a historically strong track record against Arsenal, not having lost to them since March 2023 both home and away. They are dealing with some injuries right now, but Jimenez, Willian, and Iwobi are all available and attacking threats. BTTS has hit in their last 4 H2H matchups at Arsenal, and 6 of their last 7 H2H. I see no reason why that trend shouldn’t continue."
saltcovers,"36-23-1 (+11.22U)","TOR @ CHI u239.5",-110,3,NBA,NBA,N/A,"We are going back to the well with an under in a b2b travel spot. The Bulls enter this game coming in from OKC. Josh Giddey may not play this game. He has perpetually been on the injury report with hip soreness and injury management. He is a pace up player and an over player for the Bulls. We have two top 10 under teams in this matchup. Since the all star break the Raptors are the #1 ranked defence, the Bulls rank 9th. RJ Barrett and Agbaji are out for the Raptors. Kevin Huerter is questionable for the Bulls. Looking back at the previous 3 matchups Game 1: Bulls win 122-121 in Toronto (total opened at 240.5 and closed at 239.5) Game 2: Bulls win 122-106 in Toronto (total opened at 231.5 and closed at 233.5) Game 3: Bulls win 125-115 (OT) in Chicago (total opened at 234.5 and closed at 233.5) Game 3 is most telling for me. A game played in early March with a closing total of 233.5. Yes, it went over due to overtime. That game goes way under with no OT. And I have no idea why a month later the total is priced 6 points higher. Most importantly I have the game projected at 227 so a big fat edge to the under. BOL!"
MathematicianMuch205,11-4,"Pavel Kotov ML",-120,1,Tennis,ATP Marrakech,N/A,"This was the pick I have been wanting to post since Sunday but the game kept getting pushed back, it opened as +105 and has moved all the way to -135 in some books. Anyways, I am going to state the obvious, Pavel Kotov is fat and he is a bum. However, he has been such a bum this year that he needs money for his groceries. You don't get in the way of Kotov and his food. Bellucci on the other hand is a certified bum. I know I throw that term willy nilly but this guy after playing ADM forgot how to play tennis. If you watch him play, it's like he has amnesia for most of the game because it looks like he forgets he has to put the ball between the lines not outside of it. Kotov also reached the semis of this tournament last year so I like him to beat Bellucci and go to the buffet straight afterwards."
DrowningSausage,4-1-0,"Mets ML",-148,1,MLB,MLB,"Mets @ Marlins","We are back on the Mets again today. While the pitching match up is tighter than yesterday I still feel the Mets have the edge and… have the better line up offensively (Lindor should be back). While Senga was not impressive last season, that was in the playoffs against the World Series dodgers team and a strong Phillies team. I expect him to have a solid 2025 after a healthy off season."
heatup3,"10-3 (4.29 units)","Daniel Elahi Galan ML",-140,1.4,Tennis,ATP Houston,"3:00PM EST","Galan has played mostly Challanger this year but almost all of his matches have been on clay. He's got 2 clay titles so far this year albeit at the Challanger level. Mcdonald comes in at decent form up and down as usual but lost to a semi pro Kyrgios last match. The main reason I like this is that he's lost his last ELEVEN clay matches dating back to 2022! This is green clay so it's a bit faster than normal clay courts. H2H is also in favor of Galan on clay but that was way back in 2021. Overall, clay merchant vs a guy going on 3 years without a win is too good to pass up here."
san_solares,"27-8-5 (+67.7U)","Rays -1 Asian Handicap",1.71,5,MLB,MLB,"7:05 PM EST","I still update the tracker for full transparency. Thomas Harrington is on the bump for the Pirates. He is making his major league debut today. I expect the Rays to light him up. The Pirates’ Home/Away splits are putrid when playing away. • Home Games: • Earned Run Average (ERA): 4.00 • Home Runs Allowed: 79 • Away Games: • Earned Run Average (ERA): 4.70 • Home Runs Allowed: 81 Almost a full run higher when playing away. Their pitchers, other than Skenes, suck; and their bullpen is no bueno. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Fade the Pirates. On the other hand; the Rays look like a really good team again with a really low payroll. In my opinion, Junior Caminero will be in the ASG, he is such an underrated third basemen, and the Rays offense revolves around him. Jonathan Aranda is batting well, and Jake Mangum is looking like the Rays’ revelation of the season so far. For the Rays, Shane Baz is on the mound, an extremely young pitcher with a promising 3.05 ERA and a really really solid 1.06 WHIP. I fully believe the Rays get this done."
KingRevYT,1-0 (+1 units),"New York Yankees ML",+100,1,MLB,MLB,N/A,"Feels nice to start 1-0 on this thread after following for quite some time. Rockies went up 1-0 in the 6th, but Phillies brought it right back with 4 Runs in the 7th and then ran away with it for a comfortable cash out on the -1.5 Runline! Almost feels like we won’t see this line very often. I’m not backing Will Warren as much as I am the Yankees hitting. The Yankees are absolutely blazing hot scoring 36 runs in 3 games against the brewers. It’s a small sample size but Yankees are batting .302 against RHP so far. Give me the Yankees as the slight underdog to win at home! Also forgot to mention on last pick, all bets are to win 1 unit. Unless I state i am placing more than 1 unit."
itachiuchiha2255,"72 - 56 (-4.79u)","Nottingham Forest to WIN or DRAW and Total Under 3.5 Goals",1.89,4,Soccer,England Premier League,"Nottingham Forest vs Manchester United","Nottingham Forest have been really strong at home this season and are sitting third in the league. They score 1.64 goals per home game and only let in 0.71, which shows how solid they are defensively. They haven't lost in their last five home matches, and the last three all had under 3.5 goals. With their good form and strong defense, they’ll feel good about their chances in this one. Manchester United haven’t been great this season and are struggling in 13th place. Their away form isn’t much better—they only score 1.14 goals per game while letting in 1.07. They’ve won just one of their last four away games, and three of those had under 3.5 goals. Their attack hasn’t been sharp, and breaking down Forest’s defense won’t be easy. With Forest playing well at home and United struggling away, this should be a tight game. Forest’s defense makes it hard for teams to score, and United aren’t in great form. A Nottingham win or draw with under 3.5 goals looks like a good bet."
The_Black_Syndicate,14-5-0,"St Louis Blues over 2.5 team score",-185,N/A,NHL,NHL Regular Season,"8:00 PM EST","The Blues and Red Wings played each other once this season, and the Blues put up a 4 goal shutout. They average 3 goals a game on the season, and over the last 10 games are 9-1 and  have been averaging 4.2 goals per game. The Red Wings are letting up 3.2 goals per game, which helps our case. Additionally, with the postseason around the corner, the Blues are pushing for a wild card/playoff spot, so getting points and wins will be important to them. The Blues have been improving on power play, which is a strength against Detroit’s weak penalty kill and shaky goaltending. Given the Blues’ ability to capitalize on defensive lapses and Detroit’s tendency to play in high-scoring games, they should have plenty of opportunities to find the back of the net."
billycapezzi,140-101,"Karl-Anthony Towns O22.5 P",1.83,N/A,NBA,NBA,"Knicks","First of all I understand that the spread in this game is scary hence why we get this line, but the Sixers won’t have anyone to stop him and KAT usually sees 30+ minutes even in big blowouts cause of how Thibs runs his teams. With 30+ minutes he’s over in 13/L20 games avg 24.9 PPG. Brunson is still out, without Brunson he’s over in 10/13 games and gets a big usage boost without him. He’s Avg 18+ FGA without Brunson & with 18+ FGA he’s over in 10/L10 games, hoping he gets the same kind of volume here. Sixers have allowed 2nd most points in the restricted area this season where KAT is scoring 44% of his buckets from, they’re also ranked 29th in defending above the break 3s this season where KAT gets another 30% of his scoring from. Over the L30 games they’ve allowed 2nd most points in the NBA to opposing Centers. Great matchup for KAT as the 76ers doesn’t have any size to stop him, ultimately we’re hoping that he gets going early and gets it done before the 4th if there is a blowout. If this gets bumped I do like his 1.5 threes aswell"
Pale_Tea_8937,"27-17 (+10.88u)","Forest Draw no Bet",1.75,2,Soccer,Premier League,"Nottingham Forest vs Manchester United","Forest are coming off a FA Cup quarter-final win against Brighton—which was another solid performance from them. Now back on home turf, they remain unbeaten in their last 10 home matches. They have made the City Ground a tough place for any opponent. Meanwhile, Manchester United have shown some solid performances recently. They are unbeaten in their last seven matches. Their run includes a win over Real Sociedad, a draw against Arsenal, and a victory over Ipswich despite having red card. However, Nottingham Forest have been one of the season's surprise packages, taking down several strong teams. They even defeated Manchester United at Old Trafford earlier this season. Chris Wood’s injury is a setback for Forest, But I think Forest are still capable of winning without him."

Heftystew,2-1 (+1.59u),"o2.5 total goals",+103,3,Soccer,Premier League,"Arsenal vs Fulham | 2:45 PM ET","Now onto today’s pick. Today, I have 5 words that summarize this pick. “The return of Bukayo Saka.” A long-awaited day for the gunners, especially with their struggles to score of late in the Premier League. This is the spark that they so desperately needed. Mikel Arteta was asked if Bukayo Saka was fit enough to start the match tomorrow against Fulham to which he responded, “yeah.” If you’re an Arsenal fan, you have to be jumping up and down right now! Bukayo Saka seems to be back just in time for the final stretch of their season. Their most influential player despite being out for the past 3 months. He has the second most big chances created in the league (19) only behind Mohamed Salah, and he hasn’t played since December. 15 direct goal contributions in 16 games so far this season, again, only second to Mohamed Salah. This is a breath of fresh air for Arsenal. They don’t have much to play for in the Premier League in all honesty as they are well behind Liverpool in the title race (12 points back) as well as having a 10 point cushion in the race for direct champions league qualification for next year. They do, however, have a Champions League matchup in one week against Real Madrid. They’ll want to get their starters involved in the two premier league games leading up to this beautiful clash to ensure that the team is firing on all cylinders, especially after the long international break. Think of their matchups against Fulham and Everton this week as an opportunity for Arsenal to boost their confidence and arrive to the big day with Real Madrid in good form. The vibes at Emirates Stadium must be immaculate for the match tomorrow! The return of their franchise player and the appointing of a new sporting director in Andrea Berta from Atletico Madrid both in the same week. Expect Arsenal to enjoy their football tomorrow. Fulham, their rival, have a lot to play for. This game will not be a brush over for Arsenal. Fulham are currently sitting 3 points outside of Europa League spots. They cannot afford to drop many points from now until the end of the season if they want to aspire to play continental football next season. The FA Cup was their lifeline with 5 of the Big 6 already eliminated in the competition, but after falling to Crystal Palace earlier this weekend and getting eliminated from the competition, the Premier League is their only avenue to European football for next year. Expect them to push for points in this encounter. Arsenal are averaging exactly 2 goals per game in league play at home this season even despite recent struggles. Fulham are averaging exactly 1.5 goals away from home in league play this season. Lastly, 12 of the last 17 games between these two teams have gone over the 2.5 goals mark. The same is true for 5 of the last 8 when Arsenal is the home team in this rivalry."

Blues are hot right now and I don’t think Detroit is going to be the team to cool them off. Granted 4 of their last wins have been against the Nashville and Chicago who have no shot at getting into the playoffs. I still see Blues having a similar game to their last meeting in December. Blues have been winning decisively so I see little chance of this game going to OT. Some things to look out for: Colton Parayko is out this game. The last time the Blues played the Red Wings Parayko was on the ice for all four goals in their 4-0 shutout and assisting in two of those goals."

PurpleDragonBets,"(17-11) [+6.67]","Villanova ML",-165,1.65,NCAAB,NCAAB,"8:30pm EST (FS1)","My thought process: Now before anyone questions it I know Villanova is without their head coach but I believe Interim coach Mike Nardi will be able to lead the Wildcats to victory and the Wildcats have more talent on their roster so I am betting on the players playing not the coaches. The big12 looked rough in the first day of the CBC while the big east looked good with Utah losing to Butler and with this matchup with a worse big12 team and a better big east team I cant deny this matchup as I believe the Wildcats being without their head coach is the only reason why the odds are close in this game. The Villanova Wildcats (19-14) are coming into this matchup finishing 6th out of 11 in the big east with a conference record of 11-9 in the big east. The Colorado Buffaloes (14-20) finished last in the big12 out of 16 teams and had a conference record of 3-17. Villanova has some quality wins this year with wins over Cincinnatii by 8, Uconn by 2, Xaiver by 12, Marquette by 15 and the big east champs St Johns by 2. Colorado only has one real quality wins with a win over Uconn early in the year in November of 2024, their team went on a steady decline after that, going on a 13 game losing streak when conference play started. One thing that sticks out to me is that there is a net ranking difference of 31 between these two teams and you usually dont get a net ranking differential of 25-30+ and the odds not being -200 or lower so the ML at -165 sticks out to me. Villanova has the edge in PPG, oPPG, FG%, FT% (#5 in nation), Turnovers, NET & RPI. I am expecting Eric Dixon and the Wildcats to run past the Buffaloes in this matchup and compete for a share of NIL money for the top 4 teams in this tournament."
Hey52511,7-2,"Bucks -6.5",N/A,N/A,NBA,NBA,N/A,"Alright I'm gonna look like a suns hater since ive bet against them a lot butttttttt I was writing that I was taking an alt line, but I was writing it out I was like hell na, the suns dont have KD, this may sound like an okay so what? This dude has literally been the sole reason for all of the suns wins, the fact this is not at -7.5 or -9.5 is mind blowing. Now look I understand the suns are DESPERATE to win as they face the Celtics next, and need to win to stay in the Play in as they are one game behind the kings But the truth is their ASS like what? In that Suns home game win streak KD had to carry I mean carry this team, 26 points, 8 Assists against the bulls stops the hot bulls team, Cleveland TOP SEED? 42 Points, 8 Assists, 38 Points, 5 Assists against the Bucks btw that's nearly half of this teams dam team total points at 108 vs the Bucks at 106 and then 30 points against the Celtics and 23 Points to the Wolves. My favorite part, thats so funny to me 23 minutes injured with 11 points, no one scored higher then 11 but Devin Booker at 28. Now dont get me started, Grayson Allen has been doing the same mistake passing mid air turning it over, and one that's unseen NICK RICHARDS. This man for whatever reason is not on the same wave length at the moment, maybe this may change with him needing to step up and learning from his mistakes, but he has messed up easy layups, not screening correctly where it forces teams to take the wrong shots or even better turning the ball over. Tyus Jones is also a defensive liability, Collin Gillespie has 0 confidence in himself even though hes an amazing shooter. And please don't get me started on Ryan Dunn yes he had a cool dunk, but hes a rookie same with Oso yes these guys are amazing for rookies but they simply do not know how to cut or score, with so many miscommunications that happen commonly, this can literally be seen with grabbing a rebound when shooting free throws, yes they somehow miss those boards. Not only this, but coach Buds completely COOKED THIS TEAMS CONFIDENCE LMFAO he has not played bol bol at all yes the man who dropped 20 bombs 3 games in a row to now play yes 17, 1 ,6 ,6, 9 minutes. Not only this but the Bucks got destroyed by the hawks this is a great chance to gain momentum against this suns team. Especially when you get blown out by 21, I'm sure they want to show their not a joke. I also love that the Bucks lost the to the Suns originally, it forces teams to get back, or be serious especially when they whine and trash talk to each other. Now the best part is KD is injured, and yes this guy Devin Booker cries about getting double teamed. I also think the fact they have lost there last 3 in yes 20-30 deficits, makes team moral know that they are so done for especially when your best player is now gone. Also the Bucks Schedule also plays some bad teams but they want the fifth seed which they are 2 games behind, so I expect this to still be taken seriously. The only concern there is is how hot the suns can get hot Royce, Allen, Tyus deadly streaky shooters. But I love a guaranteed bucket which is Giannis, who is going to guard him not only this but the Bucks play at home. And shooters (AJ Green, Gary Treant Jr, Kevin Porter Jr) love a home crowd especially the young rookie Ryan Rollins, the giant Brook Lopez has also looked good against the nuggets where he had no one same with Prince. Overall this suffocating defense and I think guaranteed bucket Giannis and losing to the Suns before creates a amazing opportunity to get a great win"

They are 3 points ahead of 3rd place Wycombe, but Wycombe has one less game, so Wrexham needs to win today as well to keep ahead and will want to get the win today especially against a second from the bottom team without many hopes of not getting relegated (they are 11 points behind the last team to avoid relegation with only 7 games to go). Apart from that, Wrexham have a good run of form in recent games, winning 5 of their last 6 games, 3 of the wins being in away games. Cambridge (#23) did manage 2 draws in their last 2 games, but they were a 1-1 against #19 Northampton (a lucky draw I would say as Cambridge had no shots at all in the first half of the game), another team that fights to stay above the relegation zone, and a 1-1 draw against #11 Barnsley, a team that experienced a bad run with 3 losses in a row before the draw against Cambridge. Wrexham in their last 3 games have 3 wins in a row, managing to beat #5 Stockport and #3 (now) Wycombe, ""slightly"" better teams than Cambridge, and a 2-0 win away against Exeter who managed only one shot on target. Did I say that Wrexham managed to keep clean sheets in all their 5 recent wins? They must be doing something well in defense too."

Even though things are looking up for him he still needs to make improvements. Arizona could hit this over on their own not to mention the Yankees and their new torpedo bats mashing the baseball.

Mopar44o,"23-18 (+16.58U)","Sabers Money line",2.65,1,NHL,NHL,"Sabers vs Senators","Today I’m going with a straight dog in this fight so no need to worry about covering a spread.... Both teams have played well as of late. Buffalo going 6-4 while Ottawa going 6-3-1. Both have beaten some decent competition as of late as well, but Ottawa is a playoff team and I’d expect them to. Buffalo on the other hand, well they got a 31-36-6 record but have recorded wins against Washington, Winnipeg, and Vegas in the last 10 games, all teams leading their divisions. These teams have played each other 3 times this season so far and Buffalo has given Ottawa fits each time winning 5-1, 4-0, and 3-2. I think this is a testament to how both their goalies have played well against the Senators this season, and in their careers. Luukkonen is 4-1 with a .919 save % against Ottawa life time (2-0 this year). While Reimer is 18-6-4 with a .925 save % lifetime (mostly from his time with Leafs and Florida) and 1-0 this season. Past results are not an indicator of future performance as we all know.. Which is why I generally like to consider only play over last 10 games in the same season when making my picks. But given that the Sabers have gone 3-0 against the Sens this year, their great play as of late, and how well both goalies have played Ottawa, I think that 2.65 is great value here on the money line."
major-couch-potato,"103-88 (-3.38u)","Benchetrit +6.5 games",-150,1,Tennis,ATP Marrakech,"7:00 AM EST","Pretty easy cover for Baadi. The first game was pretty wild with over 9 deuces, and painted a picture of what most of the match would end up looking like. For today's pick, I've actually found another big underdog spread that I think there's some value in, as I'm going with Elliot Benchetrit to cover against Jesper De Jong. While Benchetrit currently plays primarily on the Futures tour, that wasn't actually always the case, as he made the second round of Roland Garros in 2019 and reached a career high ranking of No. 198 in the world in 2020 before falling out of form. However, even as Benchetrit has seen his ranking slip into the 600s, he continues to put in solid performances against top players every year here in Marrakech, where he has gotten a wildcard every year since switching his flag from France to Morrocco. Last year, he took on Pavel Kotov and came back from 5-1 down in the first set to post a respectable 5-7, 3-6 scoreline; in 2023, he covered this spread in a 6-4, 6-4 loss to Munar, and in 2022, he faced a gargantuan task against Felix Auger-Aliassime but still managed to cover this spread with a 6-3, 6-3 loss. Slow clay and high altitude seem to be the perfect conditions for Benchetrit's game, and De Jong really struggled to adjust to the altitude when he played two weeks in Kigali about a month ago, as he entered as one of the outright favorites for both tournaments but came out of the trip with no wins and a retirement in the second event, so I think the conditions should favorite Elliot here. Combining that with the fact that Benchetrit has a solid serve, I just don't expect him to get blown out on the scoreboard here and really like him to cover."

Alacantra has lone been pretty much one of the only if not the only bright spot on horrible Marlins squads the last few years. A prime candidate to finally make his way out Miami at some point this year, look for Sandy to have a quality start and a shutdown early part of the game. Lindor, who sat out today due to the birth of his son, is off to a typically cold start to his season.

That being said, Vodnik was still a righty and Schwarber did his thing with the platoon edge. The man is an extra-base machine. That being said, I’m not in love with total base bets because walks are not included and very much a part of the game. This pick is in favor of a pitcher. … with ownage of course. Yeah, the A’s just got blasted tonight (Monday) by the Cubs, but that doesn’t matter. Luis Severino owns the Cubs. In two starts with the Mets last season, Severino threw 14 innings against the Cubs, recording 15 strikeouts and allowing one earned run. I don’t have to tell you that’s pretty good. On top of that, the Chicago Cubs currently lead baseball in strikeouts with 60 as a team. I know they’ve played two more games than most of the competition, but the Cubs are a team with plenty of swing and miss up in their lineup.

On to todays pick which is over 8.5 runs in the Diamondbacks and Yankees game. this should be a easy game to hit the over on as both teams are highly capable of scoring with both having over 25 runs scored this year. There is one glaring issue with this matchup and that is Corbin Burnes is starting for the Diamondbacks who is a very solid pitcher and could give the Yankees batters trouble. On the good side though is the Yankees are starting Will Warren who had a 10.32 era last year in six games which should allow the Diamond backs to get some runs. Expect this game to be close which should allow the over to hit."
FRANKLINC69420,"71-48-4 (+28.11U)","Tampa Bay Rays -1",-120,1.2,MLB,MLB,"Pittsburgh Pirates","This is only a steal of a price on ESPNbet, should be around 6 or 7 cents lower on other books. It has not updated on their books yet that Thomas Harrington is starting for the Pirates, so there's value here. Going to continue on MLB today, and I really like this spot for the Rays. Obviously we know what unfortunately happened with the Rays and Hurricane Milton, last year which wrecked Tropicana Field, so they are playing at the Yankees' Spring Training Facility, I think this is a team that has a chip on their shoulder this entire season now. This is also pretty good for the Rays, because Tropicana Field is known for being a pitcher friendly ball-park, so maybe we see some positive regression for this Rays team? They will be taking on Thomas Harrington as I mentioned, who was the Pirates 1st round selection in 2022, but does not have any real major league experience. The Rays will be sending out Shane Baz, who had a great season for the Rays last year, and although having a pretty bad Spring Training, baseball reference projects him to still have a 3.6 ERA, 1.16 WHIP season which are decent numbers from a starting pitcher. The Pirates are a team who basically did little to add for Skenes, getting Spencer Horwitz from the Jays and Veteran Tommy Pham. Well Horwitz's start is delayed due to injury, so this is basically the same lineup as last year, the only players that had an above average wRC+ were 38 year old Andrew McCutchen and Bryan Reynolds. I think the Rays are still an 80 win team with their losses last season, to Siri and Paredes. As long as Shane Baz stays solid, this Rays team should be able to get the job done."

Today the Tigers are sending Casey Mize to the mound for the start. Mize is at a weird place in his career. He turns 28 next month, it feels like he gets injured every year, and he's now in his 7th year since being taken 1st overall by the Tigers back in 2018. He's also at this point where if he's pitching in the minor leagues he's dominant, but if he's pitching in the majors he's simply average. This Spring, Mize looked incredible. He had a 1.89 ERA in over 19 innings pitched. However, to me those stats are misleading because he wasn't facing the best competition. He typically faced batters who were AAA or worse quality hitters. I have as much hope and belief in Mize as the next Tigers fan, but at this point in Mize's career there's more hype/hope in the pitcher than their are results from the pitcher. The Mariners counter with Logan Gilbert on the mound. Gilbert last season had a misleading record with great stats. He went 9-12 with a 3.23 ERA and 220 strikeouts over 208.2 innings pitched. He was also an All Star last year while finishing 6th in the AL Cy Young voting. Gilbert picked up right where he left off last season in his first start going 7 innings and only giving up 1 run against the A's in their season opener. Last night the offenses were on fire for both teams. Combining for 26 hits and 15 runs. For the Tigers however, it felt like they used a lot of good fortune to get those hits and runs. They had multiple infield singles, multiple broken bat singles, and multiple bloopers that happened to land between 2 or 3 fielders. Don't get me wrong, those are clean hits that I'd take any day of the week, but they also rely on some luck. I mean the Tigers 7 through 9 hitters in the lineup went 9-15, having half of the Tigers hits. I'm not sure that will happen again all season. Everything came easy for the Tigers offense last night, and Logan Gilbert is going to make life much more difficult for them in this one. The Mariners offense hit almost everything hard last night, and Mize historically gives up 2 to 3 runs every 5 innings pitched. If those things remain true then the Mariners should be able to win the first 5 innings in this one."

Houston is the better team on paper. I know they lost two key players in Tucker and Bregman and their bats are cold( besides red hot Altuve) but it’s only a matter of time until those bats get going especially with the new Addition of Walker and Paredes. If you want a stat that I think matters is Hayden who is HOU starter tonight, as a Cub last year posted a 1.14 WHIP which is pretty decent. Houston’s BP is what worries me. They let up 5 runs in 4 innings in that 7-2 loss. Let’s hope they can minimize those extra runs later in the game, once the relievers come in.

Gauthier is the line 2 LW at home which is what has been more consistent in my experience (line 2 players over line 1 at home). He has hit this line in 4/5 of his last games, with him still having 3 shot attempts in that one miss. He is also the main shooter on his line shooting almost 30% more than Leo Carlsson and Alex Killhorn in their last 10 games. San Jose is allowing the 3rd most sog to LW (L10 games) at 7.5 shots on goal allowed per game. They just allowed Kuzmenko 4 sog, Panarin 3 sog and McMann 6 sog. Gauthier will have more than enough opportunities to cash this line for us. If you haven’t seen me post in this thread before, the main thing about my picks that I cannot stress enough is that I choose my potd before player prop lines even drop, so on days like this I’m pleasantly surprised that we get plus odds.

We have a former Cy Young winner vs an unproven rookie. Let’s start with Corbin Burnes for ARI. In 2024, he sported an FIP- of 88, WHIP of 1.10, 3.67 K/BB, and an upper quartile GB% of 48.2%. He gets above average chase with an outside swing % of nearly 33%. This spring training he came ready to rock, and in 16 innings of work posted a stellar K/BB ratio of 11, and gave up exactly 0 home runs. Good for us is that he appears to dial things up against anyone wearing pinstripes. In his career vs current Yankees, his K/BB ratio nearly doubles at 6.81 with a K% of 32.7%, and he has held them to a .212 batting average with a wimpy  average exit velocity of 85.7 mph. Now I know the Bronx bombers and their torpedo bats seem scary, and to be honest the offensive statistics they’ve generated over 3 games is impressive. But in my humble opinion, the bats look more like bowling pins than torpedoes, and 3 games is way too small of a sample size to extrapolate to today’s matchup vs Burnes. So far 20 of their 34 hits and 16 of their 24 runs have come off of four guys including rookie reliever Connor Thomas making his MLB debut, Aaron Civale who finished in the bottom 5% for HRs allowed in the the 2024 season among starters who pitched at least 120 innings, and Nestor Cortes who was clearly having a generational bad day serving up 90mph beach balls and walking 5 in 2 innings. Now let’s talk about Will Warren. The 5th guy for New York out of necessity rather than merit due to a trio of injuries to Yankees starters. He made his MLB debut in 2024 and as a starter finished with a sorry 9.55 ERA, 1.85 WHIP, and 12 hits per 9 innings over 21.2 innings of work. His 2024 AAA minor league performance was nothing to write home about with a 5.91 ERA and 1.40 WHIP. Supposedly, he has good raw stuff with a plus slider and has been likened to Michael King. I think that comparison is a bit premature based on his performance to this point, and the reality is he’s headed straight into a buzzsaw facing a potent Diamondbacks lineup which led the league after the 2024 All-Star break with a wRC+ of 130, and has posted a first 5 innings wRC+ of 133 in 2025. Most commentators are in agreement that Warren’s arsenal against left handed hitting is lacking with a below average changeup that he’s still tinkering with. 7 of 9 hitters in today’s D-backs lineup including Corbin Carrol can hit from the left side. Read that again. So give me Corbin, Corbin, my man, and the Snakes vs a theoretically, hopefully, eventually good rookie with an abysmal MLB track record and no offspeed to disrupt a lefty heavy ARI lineup. BOL."
