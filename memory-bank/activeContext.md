# Active Context: Degen's Digest (Refactored to Reddit MCP)

**Current Focus:** Finalizing documentation updates after refactoring the workflow to use the Reddit MCP server.

**Recent Changes:**
-   Refactored the process to use the Reddit MCP server (`fetch_reddit_hot_threads`, `fetch_reddit_post_content`) instead of Playwright/Go script/manual HTML.
-   Successfully fetched top-level comments for 2025-04-01 using the Reddit MCP tool.
-   Performed NLP analysis on the fetched comments, filtering for valid POTD picks.
-   Generated the final structured report `potd_picks_2025-04-01.csv`.
-   Removed obsolete `main.go` and `raw_potd_comments_*.csv` files.
-   Updated `README.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.

**Next Steps:**
1.  Update `memory-bank/progress.md`.
2.  Attempt completion.

**Active Decisions & Considerations:**
-   **Parsing Strategy:** Relying on Cline's NLP capabilities to parse comment text fetched via the Reddit MCP server. Stricter filtering applied to identify actual POTD picks.
-   **Error Handling:** Dependent on the Reddit MCP server's error handling and Cline's ability to interpret NLP results.
-   **POTD Thread Identification:** Using title matching on results from `fetch_reddit_hot_threads`.
-   **Data Flow:** Reddit MCP Tool (Fetch Threads -> Find Post ID -> Fetch Comments) -> Cline NLP (Filter & Parse) -> Final `potd_picks_...csv`.
