# Progress: Degen's Digest (Reddit MCP Workflow Implemented)

**Current Status:** The workflow has been refactored to use the Reddit MCP server and Cline's NLP capabilities. The process for generating the daily POTD CSV report is functional. Documentation has been updated.

**What Works:**
-   Fetching hot threads from r/sportsbook via Reddit MCP tool.
-   Identifying the daily POTD thread post ID.
-   Fetching top-level comments from the POTD thread via Reddit MCP tool.
-   NLP processing of comments to filter for picks and extract structured data (Username, Record, Pick, Sport/League, Game, Reasoning).
-   Generating the final `potd_picks_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` report.
-   Project structure and Memory Bank files created and updated.
-   `README.md` updated to reflect the current workflow.

**What's Left to Build:**
-   The core task is complete. Future improvements could involve:
    -   More sophisticated NLP filtering/parsing for edge cases.
    -   Adding options for date ranges or specific threads.
    -   Integrating data validation.

**Known Issues:**
-   The process relies on the Reddit MCP server being available and functional.
-   Accuracy depends on the consistency of comment formatting and the robustness of the NLP interpretation.
-   POTD thread title format changes could break identification.
