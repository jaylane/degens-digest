# Progress: Degen's Digest (Initialization Phase)

**Current Status:** Project structure and initial documentation (Memory Bank) are being set up. The core application logic has not yet been implemented.

**What Works:**
-   Project directory created.
-   Core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`) created.

**What's Left to Build:**
1.  `.clinerules` file creation.
2.  `main.go` implementation:
    -   Playwright integration for Reddit navigation and HTML fetching.
    -   Regex-based parsing logic for comment data extraction.
    -   CSV file generation.
    -   Error handling.
3.  `README.md` creation.
4.  Testing and refinement of the scraping and parsing logic.

**Known Issues:**
-   None yet, as development hasn't started on the core application.
-   Anticipated challenges include handling inconsistent comment formats and potential changes in Reddit's website structure.
